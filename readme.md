# LSTM Implementation
It's a learning experience of pytorch to implement LSTM. The code is refered to the lstm paper. A simple test is put into demo folder. If you are not familiar with LSTM, you can have a look on paper or scan `ltm.md` in the `paper` folder. According to paper, LSTM is devided in three layers, input layer, lstm layer, output layer. And in lstm layer there are customized number of memory cells. The implementation of memory cell can be got in `memory_cell` folder. If you have any problem, pls post issue.
